## üöÄ Summary

`Leco Workload Analyzation` is a robust TypeScript-based tool designed for comprehensive analysis and visualization of workloads within Leco-powered environments. It aims to provide deep insights into performance metrics, resource utilization, and potential bottlenecks, empowering developers and administrators to optimize their applications and systems efficiently.

This project helps you understand how your Leco services or applications are performing under various load conditions, identify areas for improvement, and ensure smooth operation.

## ‚ú® Features

*   **Detailed Workload Monitoring:** Collect and process real-time or historical data on CPU usage, memory consumption, I/O operations, network activity, and other critical metrics.
*   **Performance Metric Visualization:** Generate intuitive graphs and charts to visualize workload patterns, trends, and anomalies over time.
*   **Bottleneck Detection:** Automatically identify potential performance bottlenecks by analyzing metric thresholds and correlation patterns.
*   **Customizable Reporting:** Create tailored reports with key performance indicators (KPIs) relevant to your specific Leco setup.
*   **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and interactive dashboard for easy configuration and data exploration.
*   **Extensible Architecture:** Designed to be easily extended with new data sources or analysis modules relevant to Leco's ecosystem.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

This project is built using:

*   **Language:** `TypeScript`
*   **Runtime:** `Node.js`
*   **Package Manager:** `npm` or `yarn`
*   **[Optional: Frontend Framework]**: e.g., `React`, `Vue`, or `Angular` (if it includes a web-based UI for visualization)
*   **[Optional: Data Visualization Library]**: e.g., `Chart.js`, `D3.js`, `Recharts`
*   **[Optional: Backend Framework]**: e.g., `Express.js` (if it includes an API server)

## üì¶ Installation Steps

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed:

*   `Node.js` (LTS version recommended)
*   `npm` (comes with Node.js) or `yarn`

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/Leco-Workload-Analyzation-.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd Leco-Workload-Analyzation-
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    yarn install
    ```
4.  **Build the TypeScript project:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```
5.  **Configure Environment Variables (if any):**
    If your project requires specific environment variables (e.g., API keys, database connections), create a `.env` file in the root directory and populate it as per `src/config/index.ts` or `env.example`.
    ```ini
    # .env example
    LECO_API_ENDPOINT=http://localhost:8080/metrics
    DATA_STORAGE_PATH=/var/leco/data
    ```

## üöÄ Usage Instructions

Once installed and configured, you can run the analysis tool.

1.  **Start the application:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
    This will typically start the data collection process, a local server for the UI, or a command-line interface, depending on the project's architecture.

2.  **Access the Dashboard/CLI:**
    *   **If it's a web application:** Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:[PORT]` (the default port will be displayed in the console, e.g., `3000` or `8080`).
    *   **If it's a command-line tool:** Follow the on-screen prompts or use specific commands as documented in `[docs/USAGE.md]` (if applicable) or directly via `npm run analyze -- --help`.

3.  **Configure Analysis:**
    Use the provided interface or command-line arguments to specify:
    *   The Leco service endpoints to monitor.
    *   Monitoring intervals.
    *   Data storage preferences.
    *   Reporting periods.

4.  **Interpret Results:**
    Analyze the generated graphs, charts, and reports to gain insights into your Leco workload performance and identify areas for optimization.
